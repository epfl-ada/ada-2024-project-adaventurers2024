# Welcome to the Movie Morgue üîç

Ever wondered why some movies crash and burn at the box office? We're not just talking about obvious flops - we're diving deep into the DNA of over 42,000 films to conduct a proper cinematic autopsy. 

## The Case File üìÅ

Our investigation covers everything from ill-fated release dates to questionable casting choices. Using state-of-the-art data analysis, we're examining:

- üí∞ **The Money Trail**: How much cash went up in smoke?
- üé≠ **The Usual Suspects**: Are certain actors and directors repeat offenders?
- üìÖ **The Timeline**: Does releasing your vampire romance during Christmas spell doom?
- üìñ **The Plot Thickens**: Which story tropes should come with a warning label?
