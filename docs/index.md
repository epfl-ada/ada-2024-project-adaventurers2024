### Part I: Signals of Failure
<div class="container">
  {% include plotly/rq1_metrics_distribution.html %}
</div>

We begin our exploration of the metrics associated with movie failures by analyzing three key indicators: average vote, revenue, and ROI (Return on Investment). The first step is to uncover patterns and relationships between these metrics to better understand the causes of poor movie performance. 

The scatterplot mattrix provides an overview of the relationships between three metrics. Along the diagonal, histograms display the distributions of each metric. Movie ratings are approximately normally distributed, with most falling between 6 and 7, peaking near 6.5. Revenue, however, is heavily skewed to the right, with the majority of movies earning less than $50 million, though a few outliers exceed $150 million. ROI follows a similar trend, with most values concentrated below 2, indicating that a majority of films generate modest returns relative to their costs.

The off-diagonal scatter plots reveal the pairwise correlations between these metrics, supplemented by trendlines to illustrate general patterns. Movies with higher ratings tend to earn more revenue, as shown by a slight positive correlation, though the relationship is not particularly strong. For example, a cluster of films rated between 6 and 7 generates revenues in the $20–50 million range. Similarly, there is a moderate positive correlation between ratings and ROI, suggesting that higher-rated movies are more likely to achieve better financial returns. Films with a vote_average near 7 often exhibit an ROI between 1 and 2. Interestingly, the relationship between revenue and ROI is weak but positive, indicating that high-grossing films are not necessarily the most profitable. Many movies with revenues above $100 million have ROIs under 2, reflecting high production and marketing costs.

Overall, the plot underscores that while better ratings slightly correlate with higher revenue and ROI, these relationships are nuanced, with significant variability and a concentration of movies in lower revenue and ROI ranges.


### Part II: The Actor's code: 
To measure actor diversity in movies, We focused on four key factors: age, gender, height, and ethnicity, each capturing distinct aspects of diversity within the cast. Age diversity and height diversity, as continuous variables, were measured using the standard deviation, where higher values indicate a broader range of ages or physical stature among the cast. In contrast, gender diversity and ethnicity diversity, as categorical variables, were quantified using Shannon's entropy, which effectively measures the balance of categories. Higher entropy for gender represents a more equal distribution between male and female actors, while higher entropy for ethnicity indicates greater representation of diverse ethnic backgrounds. These metrics were analyzed in relation to each movie's average rating and box office revenue to explore how actor diversity impacts audience engagement and financial success.

<div class="row">
    <div class="plotly-visualization">
      {% include plotly/rq2_revenue_boxplot.html %}
    </div>
    <div class="plotly-visualization">
      {% include plotly/rq2_rating_boxplot.html %}
    </div>
</div>

he plots explore the relationship between actor diversity and movie success, focusing on revenue and average rating as the dependent variables. Each box plot visualizes the distribution of movies grouped by diversity levels ("Low," "Medium," "High," "Very High") for four factors: age diversity, gender diversity, height diversity, and ethnicity diversity. The boxes represent the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentiles), with the central line indicating the median (50th percentile). Whiskers extend to the 5th and 95th percentiles, capturing variability in the data, while outliers are shown as individual points.

In the revenue plot, movies with "Very High" age and ethnicity diversity show relatively low revenues and slightly broader variability, with a median revenue lower than 0.5 million. It makes sense. Movies with high age diversity may not be targeted at a specific audience. For example, popular children's movies mostly star younger actors rather than targeting older actors. Seeking ethnicity diversity in the cast of actors in movies may also lead to poor recognition. For example, the recent movie The Little Mermaid was controversial for choosing a black actress to play a white character in pursuit of "political correctness."

The the rating plot, Movies with "Low" gender diversity show a lowest median ratings. This indicates that the gender of the actors in the film is too homogeneous, and may be too biased towards the audience of one gender and lose the audience of the other gender. Ethnicity diversity follows a similar pattern, with "Very High" diversity groups achieving lower ratings. However, The effect of height diversity on both income and review rate is relatively random, indicating a weak/uncertain impact on movie failure.

Overall, "Very High" ethnicity diversity and age diversity or "Low" gender diversity can be regarded as factors leading to the failure of the film, but the heatmap of diversity metrics and movie failure metrics shows that the impact is very small, less than 0.005. This shows that the audience may pay more attention to the actors' acting skills or other factors than the diversity of the actors.

Based on the heatmap, the highest absolute correlation between diversity metrics and revenue is 0.044 (from height diversity), and the highest absolute correlation between diversity metrics and average rating is 0.045 (from gender diversity). 

<div class="plotly-visualization">
  {% include plotly/rq2_correlation_heatmap.html %}
</div>

<div class="viz-container">
    <div class="plotly-visualization">
        {% include plotly/rq2_revenue_radar_chart.html %}
    </div>
    <div class="plotly-visualization">
        {% include plotly/rq2_rating_radar_chart.html %}
    </div>
</div>

The two radar plots provide a comprehensive view of how diversity metrics—age, gender, height, and ethnicity—correlate with movie revenue and average rating. Each plot visualizes the diversity metrics for two groups: one representing movies with high performance (high revenue or high rating) and the other with low performance (low revenue or low rating). The radial axis represents the normalized values of the diversity factors, ranging from 0 to 1, while the filled areas of each group illustrate the relative contributions of each diversity factor.

From the radar plots, we observe a consistent pattern: high ethnicity diversity and high age diversity are associated with lower revenue, while low gender diversity correlates with lower average rating. However, the influence of these diversity factors on movie failure appears to be small. In particular, the impact of low gender diversity on average rating is notably small. This suggests that while diversity metrics may play a role in movie outcomes, their contribution to failure is relatively limited compared to other factors that might influence audience reception, such as the quality of storytelling, acting skills.

### Part III: The Director's Enigma

<div class="plotly-visualization">
  {% include plotly/rq3_genres_to_ratings.html %}
</div>

The Sankey diagram visualizes the relationship between the number of genres explored by directors and the average ratings of their films, with the thickness of the connecting links representing the average revenue associated with these films. On the left side, we have the number of genres that directors engage with, ordered from 1 to 19, and on the right, the ratings are grouped into ranges (5.5-6, 6-6.5, 6.5-7, 7-7.5). Each link between these two sides represents a group of directors sharing a specific number of genres and their corresponding rating range, with thicker links indicating higher average revenue.

From the visualization, it appears that directors who work across fewer genres (e.g., 1-5 genres) tend to produce films with lower ratings on average. Conversely, directors who explore a moderate or larger range of genres (e.g., 7-15 genres) often produce films in higher rating ranges, such as 6.5-7 or even 7-7.5. This might because directors working with fewer genres tend to specialize in niche areas, which may appeal to a limited audience but lack the broad appeal needed for financial success.

The thickness of the links, which reflects the revenue, shows the directors explored a few (1 or 2) genres or a lot (19) genres have relatively low revenue. This may because excessive diversification (as seen in the case of 19 genres) dilute the director's expertise.

Overall, Overly specializing in a narrow range of genres or overextending across too many genres leads to movie failure, as it limits audience appeal or dilutes storytelling expertise.


### Part IV: The Genre Gamble

#### Genre Face-Off: The Anatomy of Box Office Disasters 🎭

Let's decode what our data reveals about where and why movies fail financially:

- 🎯 **The High-Risk Zones**: Adventure and Animation show the widest loss margins in their failure cases - when these big-budget genres fail, they fail spectacularly. Those massive error bars aren't just statistics; they're financial bloodbaths.

- 🏆 **The Critics' Curse**: High ratings offer no safety net. Animation and Family films maintain strong ratings (6.0+/10) but can still bomb catastrophically. Some of the biggest financial disasters came with critical acclaim attached.

- 💸 **The Genre Trap**: Documentaries and Westerns face chronic failure patterns - consistent critical respect but systematic financial underperformance. Meanwhile, Action films demonstrate how mediocre ratings don't necessarily predict financial failure.

*Key Failure Pattern: Critical acclaim and financial disaster aren't mutually exclusive - some genres are structurally prone to failure regardless of quality.*

        {% include plotly/rq4_2_genre_rating_distribution.html %}
    </div>
</div>

#### The ROI Riddle: Where Movies Go to Lose Money 💸

The return-on-investment patterns reveal Hollywood's hidden risk landscape:

- 📉 **The Budget Paradox**: "Very High" budget films show dismally low ROI (barely 1x) despite massive profits. More money, more problems?

- 🎯 **The Documentary Gambit**: 900% ROI variance tells a fascinating story - minimal losses, occasional massive wins. It's anti-blockbuster economics in action.

- ⚠️ **Risk Indicators**:
  - Higher budgets = tighter ROI spreads
  - Horror/Documentary maintain better ROI despite smaller budgets
  - High-budget failures hit hardest

*Key Pattern: The biggest financial disasters often come wrapped in the biggest budgets.*

#### The Success-Failure Paradox: When Genres Betray Their Promise 🎭

Our data reveals some fascinating contradictions in genre performance:

- 🎢 **The Volatility Champions**: Adventure and Sci-Fi lead with ~13% success rates but carry 3-4% failure rates. Welcome to Hollywood's "go big or go home" genres.

- 🔍 **The Thriller Enigma**: Leading 11% success potential paired with 4.5% failure rate makes Thrillers Hollywood's most volatile investment.

- 🎯 **The Conservative Players**: 
  - Animation/TV Movies: Low failure rates (<1%)
  - Documentaries: Rare catastrophic failures
  - The catch? Limited breakout potential

*The Pattern: Genre success often comes packaged with proportional risk of spectacular failure.*

<!-- ## Part II: The Deeper Patterns -->

#### The Heat Map of Hollywood Heartbreak 🎯

Let's decode the performance matrix that reveals the true anatomy of success and failure:

- 🔥 **The Purple Valley**: That dominant purple zone isn't just a color - it's the baseline of Hollywood performance, showing how most movies cluster around modest outcomes.

- 🌟 **Success Hotspots**: The bright yellow patches in Adventure, Fantasy, and Sci-Fi reveal the narrow band where blockbusters live. Like finding gold, it's rare but valuable.

- 💀 **Genre Graveyards**:
  - TV Movies/Documentaries: Consistently dark colors show limited upside
  - Thrillers: Color extremes confirm their high-risk profile
  - Westerns: Fading colors tell the story of a genre in decline

*Pattern Recognition: Success in Hollywood follows a power law - mediocrity is common, excellence is rare, and total failure leaves lasting scars.*

<div class="plotly-visualization full-width">

</div>

#### The Popularity Puzzle: A Beautiful Mess 📊

Now that we understand the basic patterns, let's explore how audience reception shapes success:

- 🎨 **The Genre Spectrum**: Our first scatter plot looks chaotic because it is - it's the true face of Hollywood's constant genre experimentation.

- 📈 **The Convergence Effect**: Watch how ratings stabilize as vote counts increase. It's like watching audience opinions find their true north.

- 💰 **The Money Trail**: When we switch to profit coloring, the chaos resolves into clear patterns - successful movies cluster in the high-rating, high-popularity zone.

*Key Insight: Popularity and quality aren't just metrics - they're the twin engines of sustainable success.*

### Part IV: The Temporal Dimension

#### Seasonal Patterns in Movie Failures: When Timing Meets Trouble 📊

Beyond genre and popularity, timing proves crucial in the success equation:

- 🌨️ **The Winter Challenge**: 
  - $0-9M mean profit range reveals seasonal struggles
  - High ROI volatility suggests increased risk
  - Critical acclaim doesn't guarantee winter warmth

- 🌸 **Spring's Double Edge**:
  - Peak average profits come with significant variance
  - Perfect example of high risk/high reward dynamics

- 🌞 **Summer Complexities**:
  - Traditional "blockbuster season" shows surprising vulnerability
  - ROI swings from -5 to +10 tell a story of extremes
  - Higher production costs create pressure

*The Calendar Effect: Each season brings its unique risk profile.*

<div class="plotly-visualization full-width">
    {% include plotly/rq5_1_seasonal_analysis.html %}
</div>

#### Monthly Deep Dive: The Anatomy of Movie Failures 📈

Let's zoom in to see exactly when movies are most vulnerable:

- 🥶 **January's Risk Trifecta**:
  - 2.3% high success rate (lowest)
  - 0.8% severe loss rate (highest)
  - Consistently poor ROI metrics
  - Hollywood's notorious "dump month"

- 🌞 **The Summer Paradox**:
  - June-July: 8-8.2% peak success rates
  - Accompanied by 0.8-1% severe loss rates
  - Maximum profit variance

*Monthly Insight: Success and failure peaks often align, creating seasonal risk hotspots.*

#### Historical Failure Patterns: A Century of Cinema Risk 📽️

Our final visualization shows how these patterns evolved over 100+ years:

- 🌅 **1880s-1910s: The Pioneer's Curse**:
  - Near-zero success rates
  - High-risk experimental period
  - Industry fundamentals still forming

- 📈 **1920s-1960s: The Learning Years**:
  - Steady success rate improvement
  - Winter remained the challenging season
  - Fall emergence as a viable release window

- 💡 **1970s-2010s: The Modern Era**:
  - Volume and success rates reached new heights
  - Spring 1970s breakthrough (7.2% success)
  - Winter finally caught up (10.1% in 2010s)

*Historical Perspective: While success rates have improved, fundamental seasonal patterns persist.*

### 7. What plots are the most common in movies that fail?

<div class="plotly-visualization">
  {% include plotly/rq7_tropes_boxplot.html %}
</div>

### 8. How have low-rated tropes evolved over time, and what trends can be observed in their average ratings across different periods?

Different tropes have been used in movies over the years, and some have consistently led to negative reception by audiences. Analyzing the frequency of these tropes across genres reveals interesting patterns. For example, the "Unhappy Ending" trope is prevalent in Drama and Romance films, while the "Love Triangle" trope is common in Romance and Comedy genres. By examining the distribution of these tropes across genres, we can identify which narrative elements are associated with negative audience reactions and box office failures.

<div class="plotly-visualization">
  {% include plotly/rq8_tropes_counts.html %}
</div>

Analyzing the average score of low-rated tropes across different periods reveals interesting trends. While some tropes have consistently low ratings over time, others show significant variation. For example, the "Unhappy Ending" trope has maintained a low average score of around 5.5 since the 1920s, indicating a consistent negative reception from audiences. In contrast, the "Love Triangle" trope experienced a notable decline in average rating from the 1920s to the 1980s, followed by a slight recovery in the 1990s and 2000s. This suggests changing audience preferences and storytelling trends over the decades.
