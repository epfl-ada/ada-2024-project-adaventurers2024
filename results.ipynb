    "\n",
    "- We examined distributions of key metrics (vote average, revenue, profit, and revenue-to-budget ratio) using histograms with kernel density estimation.\n",
    "- We visualized relationships between critical variables through scatter plots, particularly focusing on vote average vs. count and financial metrics vs. budget.\n",
    "- We calculated and visualized a correlation matrix to quantify relationships between `vote_average`, `vote_count`, `revenue`, `budget`, and `profit`.\n",
    "- We preprocessed the data by removing zero-value entries and calculating derived metrics such as profit and revenue-to-budget ratios.\n",
    "- We applied logarithmic transformations to handle the high skewness in financial data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Key observations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Distribution Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vote Average:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Normal distribution centered around 6.0-6.5\n",
    "   - Range primarily between 4-8\n",
    "   - Very few movies rated below 4 or above 8\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Revenue and Profit (Log Scale):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Both show right-skewed distributions\n",
    "   - Revenue peaks around 15-17 on log scale\n",
    "   - Profit shows similar pattern but with more spread\n",
    "   - Small cluster of extremely high performers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Revenue-to-Budget Ratio (Log Scale):\n",
    "   - Heavily right-skewed\n",
    "   - Most movies cluster between 0-2 (log scale)\n",
    "   - Long tail indicating few movies with exceptional ROI\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Relationship Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vote Average vs. Vote Count:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Positive correlation (0.38)\n",
    "   - Higher vote counts tend toward 6-8 rating range\n",
    "   - More rating variance with fewer votes\n",
    "   - Ratings stabilize with increased votes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Revenue/Profit vs. Budget:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Strong positive correlation (revenue-budget: 0.72)\n",
    "   - Higher budgets show wider profit variance\n",
    "   - Some high-budget outliers with exceptional returns\n",
    "   - Most movies cluster in lower budget range with moderate returns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rating vs. Revenue:\n",
    "   - Weak positive correlation (0.20)\n",
    "   - Higher-rated movies tend to have slightly better revenue\n",
    "   - Wide revenue spread regardless of rating\n",
    "   - Log-scale reveals clearer pattern at higher ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Correlation Matrix Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strongest Correlations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Revenue-Profit: 0.98 (very strong)\n",
    "   - Revenue-Vote Count: 0.77 (strong)\n",
    "   - Profit-Vote Count: 0.75 (strong)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Weak Correlations:\n",
    "   - Vote Average-Budget: 0.028 (negligible)\n",
    "   - Vote Average-Revenue: 0.20 (weak)\n",
    "   - Vote Average-Profit: 0.23 (weak)\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns suggest that while ratings have some influence on success, volume of audience engagement (vote count) and budget size are stronger predictors of financial performance. The extremely high correlation between revenue and profit suggests that cost management might be less critical than revenue generation for overall success.\n"

    "\n",
    "##### Data Cleaning and Preparation\n",
    "To begin the analysis, we removed duplicate entries. We dropped rows with missing values in critical columns, such as actor gender, age at movie release, revenue, average rating, and the number of votes, as these features are essential for the study. We mapped actor ethnicity IDs to corresponding names using `wikidata_ethnicities.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exploration of Actor Demographics\n",
    "We created a bar plot to visualize the distribution of male and female actors. We examined the age distribution of actors using a histogram to highlight age-based cast patterns. Additionally, we analyzed ethnicity diversity by counting unique ethnicities represented in the dataset and visualized the top 10 most represented ethnicities.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Computation of Diversity Metrics per Movie\n",
    "We quantified gender diversity as the proportion of female actors in a movieâ€™s cast; ethnic diversity as the number of unique ethnicities in the cast; and age diversity as the standard deviation of actors' ages. Additionally, we calculated movie failure indicators, such as revenue and ratings, for each film to assess the link between diversity and movie outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Correlation and Impact Analysis\n",
    "We constructed a correlation matrix to explore relationships between diversity metrics and movie failure indicators, including gender diversity, ethnic diversity, age diversity, revenue, and ratings. We visualized these correlations with a heatmap, highlighting the strength and direction of each relationship. We also created scatter plots to examine how gender, ethnic, and age diversity influenced revenue and ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Key observations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gender Diversity\n",
    "From the correlation matrix, we observed that gender diversity has a weak and slightly negative correlation with revenue (-0.073) and average rating (-0.048). Scatter plots indicated that movies with a less than 5% or higher than 50% proportion of female actors tended to perform slightly worse in revenue and receive lower audience ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ethnic Diversity\n",
    "We found that ethnic diversity has a moderate positive correlation with revenue (0.34), suggesting that movies with lower ethnic diversity tend to generate lower revenue. The scatter plot of ethnic diversity versus rating showed an upward trend, with movies featuring less ethnic diversity achieving lower ratings. The plot also suggests that low or high ethnic diversity (< 2 or > 9) is associated with lower revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Age Diversity\n",
    "From the correlation matrix, age diversity shows only weak positive correlations with revenue (0.14) and average rating (0.15), indicating age diversity showed limited influence on movie failure. Scatter plots revealed no strong correlation between age diversity and average rating, as movies with both high and low age diversity exhibited a wide range of ratings. In the plot of age diversity vs average rating, some movies with low or high actors' age deversity led to a lower revenue."

Categorical data related to genres was encoded numerically to enable quantitative analysis. The number of unique genres associated with each director was counted and used as a key variable in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Scatter Plot Analysis\n",
    "Two scatter plots were created to explore the relationship between directors' genre diversity and two outcome variables: overall average revenue and overall average rating. The first plot displays the overall average revenue vs the number of genres of directors, while the second plot displays the overall average ratings vs the number of genres of directors. We aimed to determine whether a directorâ€™s genre diversity correlates with commercial failure (measured by revenue) or audience disapproval (measured by ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression\n",
    "To quantify the relationships observed in the scatter plots, we conducted an OLS regression analysis with revenue and rating as dependent variables, and the number of genres of directors as the independent variable. This analysis was intended to provide statistical insight into whether an increase in genre diversity significantly predicts changes in revenue or ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Key observations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Average Revenue vs. Number of Genres \n",
    "This plot shows a dense cluster of directors with low revenue and fewer genres, suggesting that movies with limited genre diversity tend to have lower financial returns. While there are some high-revenue outliers, they are isolated cases and not representative of the overall trend. Directors with a very high number of genres (above 40) also tend to have low revenues, suggesting that excessive genre diversity may decrease a movieâ€™s appeal.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Average Rating vs. Number of Genres\n",
    "This plot reveals that directors with low genre diversity have ratings spread across the full range. However, as the number of genres increases, ratings stabilize around relatively high values (around 7), indicating that increasing genre diversity may contribute to consistent audience approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### OLS Regression\n",
    "The OLS regression results showed nan values across all metrics, including coefficients and test statistics, indicating potential issues like multicollinearity or sparse data, or suggesting that the relationship between directors' genre diversity and the outcome variables may not be linear. The lack of meaningful regression results implies that genre diversity alone may not be sufficient to predict movie failure."

    "\n",
    "We employed several analytical approaches to understand genre impact on movie failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we used violin plots with symmetric log scaling to visualize profit distribution across genres, capturing both the central tendency and spread of financial performance. \n",
    "- To understand cultural reception, we analyzed the relationship between ratings and popularity (measured by vote count) using scatter plots with logarithmic scaling for vote counts. \n",
    "- We tracked genre performance over time using 5-year moving averages to identify long-term trends in audience reception. \n",
    "- Finally, we calculated and compared genre-specific success and failure rates to identify which genres carry the highest risk of significant financial loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Key observations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Financial Performance by Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "1. High-Profit Potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action/Adventure/Fantasy lead in extreme profits (mean profits: 13-25M USD)\n",
    "- Documentary/TV Movies show lowest profits but highest ROI (9.03 and 7.13)\n",
    "- Horror shows strong ROI (5.69) with moderate investment\n",
    "- Drama (most common genre, 22,560 movies) shows modest profits (3.47M USD)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Budget Impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very low budget films: Highest ROI potential but highest volatility\n",
    "- High budget films: More consistent but lower returns\n",
    "- Clear inverse relationship between budget size and ROI potential\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Audience Reception\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ratings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Animation leads with highest average rating (6.01)\n",
    "- Family/War films follow with strong ratings\n",
    "- Western shows lowest ratings\n",
    "- Most genres maintain 5-7 rating range\n",
    "- Documentary shows most consistent ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Popularity Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Popular movies (high vote counts) cluster around 6-7 ratings\n",
    "- Less popular movies show wider rating variation\n",
    "- Profitable movies typically have high vote counts\n",
    "- Genre impact on popularity is minimal\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Historical Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ratings stabilized post-1960\n",
    "- High volatility in early years (pre-1940)\n",
    "- Modern convergence around 5-6 rating range\n",
    "- Genre distinctions decreased over time\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Risk Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Success Rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adventure/Science Fiction/Fantasy: Highest success rates\n",
    "- Documentary/TV Movies: Extreme success/failure patterns\n",
    "- Horror: Good success rate with moderate risk\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Failure Rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thriller/Science Fiction/Mystery: Highest failure rates\n",
    "- Action/Adventure: More moderate failure rates despite high budgets\n",
    "- Documentary: High risk but high potential return\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Genre significantly impacts financial performance and risk levels. While Action/Adventure/Fantasy lead in absolute profits, smaller genres like Documentary and Horror show strong ROI potential. Ratings remain relatively consistent across genres, with Animation and Family films maintaining slight advantages. Budget size shows stronger correlation with returns than genre choice.\n"

    "#### 5.2 Key observations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Seasonal Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Profitability and ROI:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Fall shows best overall performance (high ROI: 3.46, good profit distribution)\n",
    "   - Spring has highest mean profit (7.23M USD) and median ROI (1.16)\n",
    "   - Winter consistently underperforms (lowest profit: 2.56M USD, lowest ROI: 2.77)\n",
    "   - Summer shows moderate, stable performance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ratings and Volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Ratings remain relatively consistent across seasons (range: 4.72-5.19)\n",
    "   - Winter/Fall have highest release volumes (~13,000 movies each)\n",
    "   - Spring/Summer have fewer releases (~11,500 movies each)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Monthly Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strong Months:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - June/July: Highest success rates (~8%), good ROI potential\n",
    "   - December: Strong performance (high success rate, good profit potential)\n",
    "   - Summer months generally show better profit concentration\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Weak Months:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - January: Lowest success rate (~2%), volatile ROI\n",
    "   - August/September: Highest failure rates (~3%)\n",
    "   - Early fall months show increased risk\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Historical Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "- Movie volume increased significantly since 1980s\n",
    "- Success/failure rates remained relatively stable until recent years\n",
    "- Post-2000 shows increased volatility\n",
    "- Possible data anomaly showing success spike near 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Best release windows appear to be summer months (June/July) and December, while January and early fall carry higher risks. Fall and Spring show strongest overall financial metrics, but Winter consistently underperforms across all measures.\n"
