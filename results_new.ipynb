    "The first step towards analysing the role that direction plays in a film failure or success was to gather data on directors from Wikipedia. The figure shows the profile of the films released by director Terrence Malick over the years. Such profile was assembled for over 2,000 directors. A first look at the profiles shows that most directors don't have an extensive filmography, i.e. they directed 2 films or less, whilst a few individuals are very prolific. The next steps will inculde building collaboration and award profiles and identifying clusters of unsuccessful directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second figure shows the number of different genres a director explored in their filmography and the corresponding average revenue made over the course of their career. Most directors tend to focus on a limited number of genres (<20) while only a fraction of directors make films across 60+ genres. One observes that directors making films across an extreme number of genres tend to perform poorly. On the other hand, the directors with the highest-grossing filmography directed films spanning 15 to 30 genres. The picture is different when the metric used to indicate success is the IMDB rating. In this case, wildly different ratings (0-10) can be observed for directors who made films that enter a narrow range of genre categories (thid figure). Then, as the number of genre increase, the average rating over the filmography converges towards a rating of 7/10, which suggests that versatile directors tend to make good, although not great, films."

    "We employed several analytical approaches to understand genre impact on movie failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we used violin plots with symmetric log scaling to visualize profit distribution across genres, capturing both the central tendency and spread of financial performance. \n",
    "- To understand cultural reception, we analyzed the relationship between ratings and popularity (measured by vote count) using scatter plots with logarithmic scaling for vote counts. \n",
    "- We tracked genre performance over time using 5-year moving averages to identify long-term trends in audience reception. \n",
    "- Finally, we calculated and compared genre-specific success and failure rates to identify which genres carry the highest risk of significant financial loss.\n",

    "#### 4.2 Key observations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Financial Performance by Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "1. High-Profit Potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action/Adventure/Fantasy lead in extreme profits (mean profits: 13-25M USD)\n",
    "- Documentary/TV Movies show lowest profits but highest ROI (9.03 and 7.13)\n",
    "- Horror shows strong ROI (5.69) with moderate investment\n",
    "- Drama (most common genre, 22,560 movies) shows modest profits (3.47M USD)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Budget Impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very low budget films: Highest ROI potential but highest volatility\n",
    "- High budget films: More consistent but lower returns\n",
    "- Clear inverse relationship between budget size and ROI potential\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Audience Reception\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ratings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Animation leads with highest average rating (6.01)\n",
    "- Family/War films follow with strong ratings\n",
    "- Western shows lowest ratings\n",
    "- Most genres maintain 5-7 rating range\n",
    "- Documentary shows most consistent ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Popularity Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Popular movies (high vote counts) cluster around 6-7 ratings\n",
    "- Less popular movies show wider rating variation\n",
    "- Profitable movies typically have high vote counts\n",
    "- Genre impact on popularity is minimal\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Historical Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ratings stabilized post-1960\n",
    "- High volatility in early years (pre-1940)\n",
    "- Modern convergence around 5-6 rating range\n",
    "- Genre distinctions decreased over time\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Risk Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Success Rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adventure/Science Fiction/Fantasy: Highest success rates\n",
    "- Documentary/TV Movies: Extreme success/failure patterns\n",
    "- Horror: Good success rate with moderate risk\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Failure Rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thriller/Science Fiction/Mystery: Highest failure rates\n",
    "- Action/Adventure: More moderate failure rates despite high budgets\n",
    "- Documentary: High risk but high potential return\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Genre significantly impacts financial performance and risk levels. While Action/Adventure/Fantasy lead in absolute profits, smaller genres like Documentary and Horror show strong ROI potential. Ratings remain relatively consistent across genres, with Animation and Family films maintaining slight advantages. Budget size shows stronger correlation with returns than genre choice.\n"

    "2. Ratings and Volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Ratings remain relatively consistent across seasons (range: 4.72-5.19)\n",
    "   - Winter/Fall have highest release volumes (~13,000 movies each)\n",
    "   - Spring/Summer have fewer releases (~11,500 movies each)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Monthly Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strong Months:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - June/July: Highest success rates (~8%), good ROI potential\n",
    "   - December: Strong performance (high success rate, good profit potential)\n",
    "   - Summer months generally show better profit concentration\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Weak Months:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - January: Lowest success rate (~2%), volatile ROI\n",
    "   - August/September: Highest failure rates (~3%)\n",
    "   - Early fall months show increased risk\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Historical Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "- Movie volume increased significantly since 1980s\n",
    "- Success/failure rates remained relatively stable until recent years\n",
    "- Post-2000 shows increased volatility\n",
    "- Possible data anomaly showing success spike near 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Best release windows appear to be summer months (June/July) and December, while January and early fall carry higher risks. Fall and Spring show strongest overall financial metrics, but Winter consistently underperforms across all measures.\n"

    "Key observation for comedy films:\n",
    "- \"ContinuityReboot\" has the highest ratio (around 9.5x), suggesting that comedy reboots of existing properties tend to be challenging to execute well\n",
    "- Meta-industry tropes like \"NotScreenedForCritics\" and \"SlasherFilm\" (both ~5.5x) hint that comedies avoiding critical review or parodying horror often receive poor ratings\n",
    "- Plot devices like \"FakinMacGuffin\" and \"LastRequest\" (both ~8x) appear to be overused in lower quality comedies\n",
    "- Character-based tropes such as \"TeenSuperspy\" and \"LiteralSplitPersonality\" (both ~5x) show that certain character archetypes may be harder to execute successfully\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps:** We will expand the previous analysis to include all the genres, comparing the results to identify differences and similarities in how tropes influence reception across genres. Additionally, we plan to investigate the occurrence of tropes combinations in movies that failed by examining different tuples of up to three tropes, such as (\"Love Triangle\", \"Secret Identity\", \"Big Damn Kiss\"), to determine if certain trope combinations are more prone to result in a movie's failure."
