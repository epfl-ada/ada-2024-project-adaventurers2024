    "- We examined distributions of key metrics (vote average, revenue, profit, and revenue-to-budget ratio) using histograms with kernel density estimation.\n",
    "- We visualized relationships between critical variables through scatter plots, particularly focusing on vote average vs. count and financial metrics vs. budget.\n",
    "- We calculated and visualized a correlation matrix to quantify relationships between `vote_average`, `vote_count`, `revenue`, `budget`, and `profit`.\n",
    "- We preprocessed the data by removing zero-value entries and calculating derived metrics such as profit and revenue-to-budget ratios.\n",
    "- We applied logarithmic transformations to handle the high skewness in financial data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Key observations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Distribution Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vote Average:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Normal distribution centered around 6.0-6.5\n",
    "   - Range primarily between 4-8\n",
    "   - Very few movies rated below 4 or above 8\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Revenue and Profit (Log Scale):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Both show right-skewed distributions\n",
    "   - Revenue peaks around 15-17 on log scale\n",
    "   - Profit shows similar pattern but with more spread\n",
    "   - Small cluster of extremely high performers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Revenue-to-Budget Ratio (Log Scale):\n",
    "   - Heavily right-skewed\n",
    "   - Most movies cluster between 0-2 (log scale)\n",
    "   - Long tail indicating few movies with exceptional ROI\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Relationship Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vote Average vs. Vote Count:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Positive correlation (0.38)\n",
    "   - Higher vote counts tend toward 6-8 rating range\n",
    "   - More rating variance with fewer votes\n",
    "   - Ratings stabilize with increased votes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Revenue/Profit vs. Budget:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Strong positive correlation (revenue-budget: 0.72)\n",
    "   - Higher budgets show wider profit variance\n",
    "   - Some high-budget outliers with exceptional returns\n",
    "   - Most movies cluster in lower budget range with moderate returns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rating vs. Revenue:\n",
    "   - Weak positive correlation (0.20)\n",
    "   - Higher-rated movies tend to have slightly better revenue\n",
    "   - Wide revenue spread regardless of rating\n",
    "   - Log-scale reveals clearer pattern at higher ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Correlation Matrix Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strongest Correlations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Revenue-Profit: 0.98 (very strong)\n",
    "   - Revenue-Vote Count: 0.77 (strong)\n",
    "   - Profit-Vote Count: 0.75 (strong)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Weak Correlations:\n",
    "   - Vote Average-Budget: 0.028 (negligible)\n",
    "   - Vote Average-Revenue: 0.20 (weak)\n",
    "   - Vote Average-Profit: 0.23 (weak)\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns suggest that while ratings have some influence on success, volume of audience engagement (vote count) and budget size are stronger predictors of financial performance. The extremely high correlation between revenue and profit suggests that cost management might be less critical than revenue generation for overall success.\n"

    "The first step towards analysing the role that direction plays in a film failure or success was to gather data on directors from Wikipedia. The figure shows the profile of the films released by director Terrence Malick over the years. Such profile was assembled for over 2,000 directors. A first look at the profiles shows that most directors don't have an extensive filmography, i.e. they directed 2 films or less, whilst a few individuals are very prolific. The next steps will inculde building collaboration and award profiles and identifying clusters of unsuccessful directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second figure shows the number of different genres a director explored in their filmography and the corresponding average revenue made over the course of their career. Most directors tend to focus on a limited number of genres (<20) while only a fraction of directors make films across 60+ genres. One observes that directors making films across an extreme number of genres tend to perform poorly. On the other hand, the directors with the highest-grossing filmography directed films spanning 15 to 30 genres. The picture is different when the metric used to indicate success is the IMDB rating. In this case, wildly different ratings (0-10) can be observed for directors who made films that enter a narrow range of genre categories (thid figure). Then, as the number of genre increase, the average rating over the filmography converges towards a rating of 7/10, which suggests that versatile directors tend to make good, although not great, films."

    "- Modern convergence around 5-6 rating range\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Risk Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Success Rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adventure/Science Fiction/Fantasy: Highest success rates\n",
    "- Documentary/TV Movies: Extreme success/failure patterns\n",
    "- Horror: Good success rate with moderate risk\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Failure Rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thriller/Science Fiction/Mystery: Highest failure rates\n",
    "- Action/Adventure: More moderate failure rates despite high budgets\n",
    "- Documentary: High risk but high potential return\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Genre significantly impacts financial performance and risk levels. While Action/Adventure/Fantasy lead in absolute profits, smaller genres like Documentary and Horror show strong ROI potential. Ratings remain relatively consistent across genres, with Animation and Family films maintaining slight advantages. Budget size shows stronger correlation with returns than genre choice.\n"

For each genre, we categorized films into low-rated (â‰¤6.0) and high-rated (>6.0) groups and analyzed the tropes associated with each category. To highlight tropes that were disproportionately present in poorly received films, we calculated the ratio of trope occurrences in low-rated films to high-rated films. Finally, we visualized the top 10 tropes with the highest low-to-high rating ratios for each genre to identify patterns that might contribute to negative audience reception. The y-axis lists the tropes, while the x-axis shows the ratio of appearance in low-rated vs. high-rated films.\n",

    "- \"NotScreenedForCritics\" tops the list (about 7.5x ratio), appearing in both comedy and adventure genres' low-rated films, suggesting it's a reliable indicator of lower quality across genres\n",
    "- Superhero-related tropes (\"Superman\" and \"TeenSuperspy\" at ~6x and 5x respectively) indicate that certain superhero elements may be challenging to execute well in adventure films\n",
    "\n",
    "Key observation for comedy films:\n",
    "- \"ContinuityReboot\" has the highest ratio (around 9.5x), suggesting that comedy reboots of existing properties tend to be challenging to execute well\n",
    "- Meta-industry tropes like \"NotScreenedForCritics\" and \"SlasherFilm\" (both ~5.5x) hint that comedies avoiding critical review or parodying horror often receive poor ratings\n",
    "- Plot devices like \"FakinMacGuffin\" and \"LastRequest\" (both ~8x) appear to be overused in lower quality comedies\n",
    "- Character-based tropes such as \"TeenSuperspy\" and \"LiteralSplitPersonality\" (both ~5x) show that certain character archetypes may be harder to execute successfully\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.3. Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "We will expand the previous analysis to include all the genres, comparing the results to identify differences and similarities in how tropes influence reception across genres. Additionally, we plan to investigate the occurrence of tropes combinations in movies that failed by examining different tuples of up to three tropes, such as (\"Love Triangle\", \"Secret Identity\", \"Big Damn Kiss\"), to determine if certain trope combinations are more prone to result in a movie's failure."
