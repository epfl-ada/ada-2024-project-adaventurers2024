    "##### Data Cleaning and Preparation\n",
    "To begin the analysis, we removed duplicate entries. We dropped rows with missing values in critical columns, such as actor gender, age at movie release, revenue, average rating, and the number of votes, as these features are essential for the study. We mapped actor ethnicity IDs to corresponding names using `wikidata_ethnicities.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exploration of Actor Demographics\n",
    "We created a bar plot to visualize the distribution of male and female actors. We examined the age distribution of actors using a histogram to highlight age-based cast patterns. Additionally, we analyzed ethnicity diversity by counting unique ethnicities represented in the dataset and visualized the top 10 most represented ethnicities.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Computation of Diversity Metrics per Movie\n",
    "We quantified gender diversity as the proportion of female actors in a movieâ€™s cast; ethnic diversity as the number of unique ethnicities in the cast; and age diversity as the standard deviation of actors' ages. Additionally, we calculated movie success indicators, such as revenue and ratings, for each film to assess the link between diversity and movie outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Correlation and Impact Analysis\n",
    "We constructed a correlation matrix to explore relationships between diversity metrics and movie success indicators, including gender diversity, ethnic diversity, age diversity, revenue, and ratings. We visualized these correlations with a heatmap, highlighting the strength and direction of each relationship. We also created scatter plots to examine how gender, ethnic, and age diversity influenced revenue and ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Key observations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gender Diversity\n",
    "From the correlation matrix, we observed that gender diversity has a weak and slightly negative correlation with revenue (-0.073) and average rating (-0.048). Scatter plots indicated that movies with a 5%-50% proportion of female actors tended to perform slightly better in revenue and receive better audience ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ethnic Diversity\n",
    "We found that ethnic diversity has a moderate positive correlation with revenue (0.34), suggesting that movies with more ethnic diversity tend to generate higher revenue. The scatter plot of ethnic diversity versus rating showed an upward trend, with movies featuring more ethnic diversity achieving better ratings. The plot also suggests that moderate ethnic diversity (3-7) is associated with higher revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Age Diversity\n",
    "From the correlation matrix, age diversity shows only weak positive correlations with revenue (0.14) and average rating (0.15), indicating age diversity showed limited influence on movie success. Scatter plots revealed no strong correlation between age diversity and average rating, as movies with both high and low age diversity exhibited a wide range of ratings. In the plot of age diversity vs average rating, some movies with moderate actors' age deversity achived a higher revenue."

    "\n",
    "- First, we used violin plots with symmetric log scaling to visualize profit distribution across genres, capturing both the central tendency and spread of financial performance. \n",
    "- To understand cultural reception, we analyzed the relationship between ratings and popularity (measured by vote count) using scatter plots with logarithmic scaling for vote counts. \n",
    "- We tracked genre performance over time using 5-year moving averages to identify long-term trends in audience reception. \n",
    "- Finally, we calculated and compared genre-specific success and failure rates to identify which genres carry the highest risk of significant financial loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Key observations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Financial Performance by Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "1. High-Profit Potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action/Adventure/Fantasy lead in extreme profits (mean profits: 13-25M USD)\n",
    "- Documentary/TV Movies show lowest profits but highest ROI (9.03 and 7.13)\n",
    "- Horror shows strong ROI (5.69) with moderate investment\n",
    "- Drama (most common genre, 22,560 movies) shows modest profits (3.47M USD)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Budget Impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very low budget films: Highest ROI potential but highest volatility\n",
    "- High budget films: More consistent but lower returns\n",
    "- Clear inverse relationship between budget size and ROI potential\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Audience Reception\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ratings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Animation leads with highest average rating (6.01)\n",
    "- Family/War films follow with strong ratings\n",
    "- Western shows lowest ratings\n",
    "- Most genres maintain 5-7 rating range\n",
    "- Documentary shows most consistent ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Popularity Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Popular movies (high vote counts) cluster around 6-7 ratings\n",
    "- Less popular movies show wider rating variation\n",
    "- Profitable movies typically have high vote counts\n",
    "- Genre impact on popularity is minimal\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Historical Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ratings stabilized post-1960\n",
    "- High volatility in early years (pre-1940)\n",
    "- Modern convergence around 5-6 rating range\n",
    "- Genre distinctions decreased over time\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Risk Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Success Rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adventure/Science Fiction/Fantasy: Highest success rates\n",
    "- Documentary/TV Movies: Extreme success/failure patterns\n",
    "- Horror: Good success rate with moderate risk\n",

    "2. Failure Rates:\n",

    "- Thriller/Science Fiction/Mystery: Highest failure rates\n",
    "- Action/Adventure: More moderate failure rates despite high budgets\n",
    "- Documentary: High risk but high potential return\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Genre significantly impacts financial performance and risk levels. While Action/Adventure/Fantasy lead in absolute profits, smaller genres like Documentary and Horror show strong ROI potential. Ratings remain relatively consistent across genres, with Animation and Family films maintaining slight advantages. Budget size shows stronger correlation with returns than genre choice.\n"

    "\n",
    "   - June/July: Highest success rates (~8%), good ROI potential\n",
    "   - December: Strong performance (high success rate, good profit potential)\n",

    "   - August/September: Highest failure rates (~3%)\n",
    "   - Early fall months show increased risk\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Historical Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "- Movie volume increased significantly since 1980s\n",
    "- Success/failure rates remained relatively stable until recent years\n",
    "- Post-2000 shows increased volatility\n",
    "- Possible data anomaly showing success spike near 2020\n",

    "##### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
